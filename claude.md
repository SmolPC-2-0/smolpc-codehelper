## Project Overview

SmolPC Code Helper is an **offline AI coding assistant** for secondary school students (ages 11-18).

**Principles:** offline-first (no cloud/telemetry), privacy-first (GDPR/FERPA), budget hardware (8GB RAM min), Intel NPU partnership (OpenVINO is primary acceleration target on Windows).

**Stack:** Rust engine (`axum` HTTP server) + Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind 4

**Architecture:** `engine/` contains the shared inference server (`smolpc-engine-host` + `smolpc-engine-core`). `apps/` contains product apps (Code Helper is the first). `launcher/` is the suite shell. The engine runs as a local HTTP server; Tauri apps connect via `smolpc-engine-client` over HTTP + SSE.

**Backend selection priority:** `directml` > `openvino_npu` > `cpu`

**Current runtime status:** the supported shared model baseline is `qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct` (default) plus `qwen3-4b`. OpenVINO CPU and OpenVINO NPU now use structured chat history for normal chat requests; only explicit legacy ChatML payloads stay on the prompt-compatibility path.

## Conventions

**DLL loading is centralized.** All `Library::new()` / `load_with_flags()` calls live in `runtime_loading.rs`. A source-invariant test enforces this — adding DLL loading elsewhere fails CI.

**OpenVINO DLL load order matters.** Windows requires dependency order: `tbb12 -> openvino -> openvino_c -> openvino_ir_frontend -> openvino_intel_cpu_plugin -> openvino_intel_npu_plugin -> openvino_tokenizers -> openvino_genai`

**OpenVINO models must be IR format.** The OpenVINO lane expects `.xml` + `.bin` artifacts, not ONNX. The `openvino/manifest.json` is the artifact readiness gate.

**Preflight timeout = temporary fallback.** A preflight timeout must NOT be persisted as a negative decision. It stays `temporary_fallback` and does not overwrite a prior good record.

**Engine host owns all backend policy.** Launcher and Tauri app consume status only — they must not rank backends or override engine selection.

**Engine lifecycle owned by EngineSupervisor.** A single tokio task owns spawn/kill/health/restart. Tauri commands never spawn or kill the engine directly — they send commands via mpsc channel and read state via watch channel.

**Use `tauri::async_runtime::spawn` not `tokio::spawn` in `Builder::setup()`.** Tauri manages its own Tokio runtime; bare `tokio::spawn` in setup may target a different runtime or panic if none is active.

**Commands get engine client via `supervisor.get_client(timeout)`.** The handle waits on a watch channel — no Mutex needed. `get_client_if_ready()` is the non-blocking variant.

**Runtime mode preference must be in the Start command.** Never apply runtime mode post-spawn — that kills and respawns the engine. Pass it in `StartupConfig` so the supervisor sets `SMOLPC_FORCE_EP` before spawning.

**Svelte 5 runes only.** No `writable` / `readable` from `svelte/store`. Use `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`.

**Tailwind 4.** No `@apply` — use utility classes directly in templates.

**Tauri Channels for streaming.** Use `tauri::ipc::Channel<T>` (command-scoped, ordered), not global Events.

**Conventional Commits with scope.** `feat(engine):`, `fix(openvino):`, `docs:`, etc.

**No AI attribution in commits or PRs.** Do not add `Co-Authored-By` lines to commits. Do not add "Generated with Claude Code" or similar attribution to PR descriptions.

**Pre-commit checks:**
```bash
cargo check --workspace && cargo clippy --workspace
cargo test -p smolpc-engine-core && cargo test -p smolpc-engine-host
cd apps/codehelper && npm run check && npm run lint
```

**Plugin and tool usage (mandatory):**

*Code intelligence — always use LSP over grep:*
- When tracing symbol usage: `LSP findReferences` (Rust) or TypeScript LSP (frontend)
- When finding where something is defined: `LSP goToDefinition`
- When checking what calls a function: `LSP incomingCalls`
- When removing/renaming a field or function: `LSP findReferences` first to find ALL consumers
- Subagents exploring the codebase MUST be instructed to use LSP

*Superpowers plugin — invoke via Skill tool when the trigger matches:*
- **Brainstorming** (`superpowers:brainstorming`): User says "let's brainstorm", "be creative", "what are our options", or asks to explore architectural decisions. Invoke BEFORE proposing solutions.
- **Writing plans** (`superpowers:writing-plans`): When given specs/requirements for a multi-step task, before touching code. Use instead of ad-hoc plan files.
- **Executing plans** (`superpowers:executing-plans`): When a written plan exists and is approved. Provides review checkpoints during implementation.
- **Verification before completion** (`superpowers:verification-before-completion`): BEFORE claiming work is done, fixed, or passing. Run verification commands, confirm output, THEN claim success. Never say "should work" — prove it works.
- **Receiving code review** (`superpowers:receiving-code-review`): When processing review feedback. Requires technical rigour — verify the reviewer's claims against the code before implementing fixes. Don't blindly agree.
- **Systematic debugging** (`superpowers:systematic-debugging`): When encountering bugs, test failures, or unexpected behavior. Use before proposing fixes.
- **Dispatching parallel agents** (`superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`): When facing 2+ independent tasks that can be parallelised.
- **Code review** (`superpowers:requesting-code-review`): When completing major features or before merging — verify work meets requirements.

## Learnings

Corrections discovered during development. **When you correct a mistake, append a one-line rule here.**

- OpenVINO GenAI handles its own tokenization — Rust `TokenizerWrapper` is not involved for the NPU lane
- OpenVINO 2026.0.0 is the pinned tuple — `openvino`, `openvino_genai`, `openvino_tokenizers` must match; mixing breaks ABI
- Use INT4, not NF4, for broad NPU compatibility — NF4 only works on Core Ultra Series 2+
- Qwen2.5 has TWO stop tokens: `<|endoftext|>` (151643) + `<|im_end|>` (151645) — check both
- OpenVINO GenAI chat requests must use structured message history on CPU and NPU; keep the preformatted ChatML string path only for explicit legacy compatibility
- Use `OnceLock<Result>` over `Once` for fallible init — `Once::call_once` can't return values
- Use `AtomicBool` over `try_lock()` for state tracking — `try_lock()` creates TOCTOU races
- Bundle fingerprint auto-invalidates on DLL change — mtime change forces fresh backend selection
- Don't dismiss broken checks as "pre-existing" - if verification fails, fix it in the current session
- Selection profile constant (`OPENVINO_SELECTION_PROFILE`) change forces re-evaluation of all cached decisions
- NPU compilation is slow on first load but fast after - `CACHE_DIR` enables compiled blob reuse
- Qwen3 OpenVINO support is currently non-thinking only; align temperature, top_p, top_k, and presence_penalty with the upstream non-thinking guidance
- Do NOT set `min_new_tokens` on OpenVINO GenAI 2026.0.0 — any value >= 1 permanently suppresses EOS detection, causing runaway generation
- PowerShell wrappers around native tools must coerce stderr records to plain strings before logging or `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` will treat normal tool output as a fatal error
- After a long-running model export times out at the shell layer, check for orphaned builder `python` processes before retrying or the next validation pass starts from a dirty state
- Do not hard-block DirectML mode selection on the background hardware probe; the probe can time out while DirectML runtime initialization still works with a valid staged artifact
- NPU StaticLLMPipeline only supports greedy decoding — always force do_sample=false for NPU target
- presence_penalty is incompatible with NPU greedy decoding — skip it on NPU
- NPU StaticLLMPipeline does not support extra_context API for thinking control — inject /nothink into the system message content instead
- Force-backend env var is `SMOLPC_FORCE_EP` (not `SMOLPC_FORCE_BACKEND`)
- Use `starts_with` not `contains` for directive idempotency checks — `contains` matches user content substrings
- Qwen3 chat_template.jinja defaults to thinking mode when enable_thinking is undefined — NPU requires the template condition to be patched to default to non-thinking
- Qwen3-4B INT4 produces garbage on NPU but INT8_SYM per-channel (via `nncf.compress_weights`) works — INT8 is the NPU variant, INT4 stays for CPU
- Model idle unload must default to disabled (None) — a 30s timeout causes the "unhealthy after idle" bug
- HuggingFace `tokenizer_config.json` `chat_template` can be a string OR an array of `{name, template}` objects — handle both
- Use `env_logger::init()` in the engine host main() — without it, all log::info!/warn! calls are silently discarded
- Qwen3 NPU template patch failure must be a hard error, not a warning — un-patched template defaults to thinking mode causing runaway generation
- CPU and DirectML preflights need timeouts (30s/60s) via spawn_blocking — a hung GPU driver or malformed model can block the load path forever
- Use a drop guard (TransitionGuard) for model_transition_in_progress — load_model has many early return paths
- In PowerShell packaging scripts, use `$env:SystemRoot\System32\tar.exe` not bare `tar` — Git Bash tar intercepts and can't handle Windows paths
- PowerShell `Compress-Archive` has a 2 GB limit — use Windows tar.exe for large model archives
- PowerShell array splatting (`@array`) can split flag strings — use explicit if/else for cargo build flags
- Tauri resource map format (`"libs/": "libs/"`) recursively copies directories including subdirectories — preferred over glob arrays for nested DLL layouts
- DirectML on Intel integrated GPU produces garbage (no EOS, runaway generation) — only accept discrete GPUs as DirectML candidates
- Tauri NSIS `installMode: "currentUser"` installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<productName>\` and kebab-cases the binary name (e.g., `smolpc-code-helper.exe`)
- Detached engine processes must redirect stderr to a log file — `Stdio::null()` makes crash diagnosis impossible on user machines
- `npm ci` fails with EPERM on Tailwind's `.node` binary when VS Code Tailwind IntelliSense extension holds a file lock — close VS Code or disable the extension before running `npm ci`
- Tauri 2 `Builder::run()` has no RunEvent access — use `Builder::build()` + `App::run(callback)` to hook `ExitRequested` for cleanup
- Use `tauri::async_runtime::block_on()` for async cleanup in `RunEvent::ExitRequested` — the closure is sync (`FnMut`), not async
- Engine PID must be written to `engine.pid` on spawn — DETACHED_PROCESS children survive parent exit and need explicit cleanup
- Verify PID identity before force-killing — stale `engine.pid` after crash can match a reused PID from an unrelated process
- Clean up `engine.pid` on both graceful exit and after force-kill to prevent stale PID accumulation
- GIMP NSIS installer defaults to per-user install at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\GIMP 3\`, not `Program Files` — check both paths
- GIMP 3.2 creates its profile under `GIMP/3.2/`, not `GIMP/3.0/` — resolve profile version dynamically by scanning the config root
- Blender version detection must use dynamic directory enumeration, not hardcoded versions — Blender Foundation updates version numbers frequently
- When removing a dependency, trace every consumed field to its terminal behavior — a "hint" boolean can be a hard gate downstream (e.g., `npu_hardware_detected` gates the entire OpenVINO probe)
- After replacing a hardware data source, verify all backend paths with live tests (`SMOLPC_FORCE_EP=openvino_npu` curl test) — unit tests don't catch hardware path regressions
- DXGI adapter enumeration is 1000x faster than WMI for GPU detection — use `IDXGIFactory6::EnumAdapterByGpuPreference` with fallback to `IDXGIFactory1::EnumAdapters1`
- Always use the LSP tool (`findReferences`, `incomingCalls`, `goToDefinition`) when tracing symbol usage — grep misses indirect consumers and caused the NPU regression. Subagents exploring the codebase must also be instructed to use LSP.
- NPU StaticLLMPipeline has a fixed context window: MAX_PROMPT_LEN (input) + MIN_RESPONSE_LEN (output). Exceeding MAX_PROMPT_LEN crashes with "unknown exception". Intel's default is 1024 — don't go below without good reason.
- There is no tokenizer in the OpenVINO GenAI C API — token counting from Rust requires either the `tokenizers` crate with the model's tokenizer.json, or a character-based heuristic (~3.5 chars/token for Qwen)
